#  Stock Market Trend Analysis

##  Project Overview
This project aims to analyze stock market trends using **historical stock data** and **sentiment analysis** from news headlines and social media. The goal is to develop predictive models that assist in making informed investment decisions.

##  Features
 **Stock Data Analysis**: Visualizing historical stock prices and key indicators (SMA, EMA, RSI, MACD).  
 **Sentiment Analysis**: Extracting sentiment scores from financial news and social media.  
 **Machine Learning Models**: Implementing **Random Forest, LSTM, and XGBoost** for trend prediction.  
 **Dashboard**: Interactive visualization of stock price trends and sentiment impact.  
 **Data Pipeline**: Automated preprocessing of stock and sentiment data.
